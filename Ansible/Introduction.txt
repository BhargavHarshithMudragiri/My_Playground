Ansible is a open source, IT automation software application written in Python.
It is used to configure systems, deploy software and orchestrate advanced workflows to support application deployment, system updates and more.

Ansible lets you automate any task virtually. Here are some use cases for Ansible
1. Eliminate Repetetion and simplify workflows
2. Manage and Maintain System Configuration
3. Continously Deploy complex software
4. Perform Zero downtime rolling updates

Ansible uses simple, human readable scripts called Playbooks to automate tasks. 
You declare the desired state of your local or remote system and ansible ensures that the system remains in that state.

As automation technology, ansible is designed around the following principles:

1. Agentless Architecture: Low Maintenance overhead as it avoids the additional software installation across IT infrastucture.
2. Simplicity: Ansible Playbooks use straight forward YAML syntax to code that reads like documentation. Ansible is also decentralized, using SSH with OS credentials
               to access to remote machines.
3. Scalability & Flexibiliy: Easily and Quickly scales the system that you automate through a modular design that supports a large range of operating systems, network
                             devices, cloud platforms
3. Idempotence & Predictability: When the system is in the state that your ansible playbook described, then ansible does not change anything even if the playbook runs
                                 multiple times.

Ansible contains three main components:

1. Control Node - A System on which Ansible is installed. You can run commands such as ansible and ansible-inventory on a control node.
2. Inventory - A list of managed nodes that are logically organised. You create a inventory on control node to describe host deployments to ansible.
3. Managed Node - A remote system or host that ansible controls.
